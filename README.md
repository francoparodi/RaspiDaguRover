# RaspiDaguRover

A simple web 'table score' for 'table football', designed to run on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Two IR sensors (TCRT5000), connected to Raspberry, detect goals and notify the web page to increase team score properly.

Any client connected to web page will be notified about score changes, due to websocket ([socket.io](https://socket.io/)) technology.

Score can be manually increased or decreased by 'plus-minus' and cleared by 'Reset' link.
